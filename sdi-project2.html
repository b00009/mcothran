<p>I chose to continue with the game idea I submitted last week. Because it is something that I am passonate about I find it easy to write the story and code.</p>
<p>When we last left Rowen (the witches apprentice), she just had learned about the capture of her pedagogue Gwendolyn (the White Witch). Feeling alone she began speaking to her shadow. Which she found Gwendolyn had enchanted to be her familier (guide/concience).
Now Rowen must prepare for her journey into the "dark forest", so that she can travel to Salem and rescue the White Witch. She will find items that will help her avoid any patrols of witch hunters, or other dangers she may encounter.    </p>
